This is a data analysis project that was constructed with the help of the website GeeksforGeeks. In this project, we are working with a CSV file, Zomato-Data, which is analysed for the following purposes:
1. Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?
2. Which types of restaurants are the most favoured by the general public?
3. What price range do couples prefer for their dinner at restaurants?

We are making use of this CSV file to get access to the data of Zomato and this analysis is done using Python and its following libraries:
* NumPy - With NumPy arrays, complex computations are executed quickly, and large calculations are handled efficiently.
* Matplotlib - It has a wide range of features for creating high-quality plots, charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more.
* Pandas - The library simplifies the loading of data frames into 2D arrays and provides functions for performing multiple analysis tasks in a single operation.
* Seaborn - It offers a high-level interface for creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics.

This is the project in which we are analysing how different it is to order food online and offline. Whether people prefer online or offline, and if online, then what is their suitable price range, 
what type of items they prefer to be purchased online and what they prefer to go in-person to the restaurant to have.
This analysis in turn would help us to understand what changes can be brought to abide by all the requirements of the customers.
